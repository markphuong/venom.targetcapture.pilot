v3 -- has low cov across predicted exon region removed and 1/1 bases changed
v4 -- merged all contigs that were at least 98% identity using cd-hit-est

v5 -- sequences that are masked for coverage -- essentially final genes


you applied cdhit to v3, creating v4

you remapped everything, and then did the final coverage filtering, where you masked sequences below 10X coverage for downstream analysis. (v5)
you also removed any sequence that did not maintain 10X coverage across the exon region
