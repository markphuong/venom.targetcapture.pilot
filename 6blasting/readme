sbatch exonblastbatch


runs python chooseone.py

-- you originally ran all seeds with PRICE using 5 MPI values. this script chooses the longest contig out of the 5 interations


then, runs simple blasts and keeps the best hit for each assembled contig, only if they align across the entire defined exon region in the reference

creates:

1. *.blastfail -- lists hits that did not align across the entire reference
2. *_best_venom_hits.fasta -- fasta file containing the contigs that matched the criteria above (had blast hit across entire predicted exon reference)
3. *.venom_exon.filtered.blastoutput -- best hits in the correct orientation

you did an initial blast so that you could filter out poor hits, and then you used swap_orientation to orient everything in the correct way. this made it easier for processing in later steps
you did another blast where you limited the results to just one hit per assembled contig, and the results were consistent with previous trials of trying to get a filtered blast output set.
