OBJECTIVE: from phuong et al. 2016, need to denote exon boundaries for all gene superfamilies so that 

for the 12 species with transcriptomes, brought the following:

1. _venom_contigs_reassembled.fa from /pylon2/bi4s86p/phuong/venom/3reassembled
2. all_extractedseq_renamed.fa from /nfs/LabShared/MarkPhuong/final/analyses/process_Summary_stats/2separateSpecies
3. all_proteins_renamed.fa from /nfs/LabShared/MarkPhuong/final/analyses/process_Summary_stats/2separateSpecies


python SeparateSpecies.py

-- separates the gene superfamilies into two separate files.

creates:

1. _venomprots.fa
2. _extractedseq.fa



python venom_exon_wrapper.py --map species_name_mapping

-- wraps venom_exon_boundaries.py which does the following:

a. python makesomethingNotInterleaved.py
	- creates '*_venom_contigs_reassembled.fa.NI' file 
b. python chooseone.py
	- creates '*_venom_contigs_reassembled.fa.NI.subset' file (you ran PRICE for 5 MPI values, and you chose the longest contig per 'seed' value)

for each protein identified from transcriptome work, blast it to the assembled exon capture data venom genes for that specific gene family, 
and find the contigs that blast to the first and second exon/intron, then create a genomic sequence by combining the two contigs and
run exnerate and get the exact cutting coordinates.

creates:

1. venomblastcoordfile -- saves blast values for saved contigs that were used as the genomic sequence for exonerate to define exon/intron boundaries
2. venombed -- exact cut coordinates from exonerate
3. .didnotblast -- proteins that did not blast to anything (probably because you didn't target them)

python slice_proteins.py

requires:

1. A_super_seq.fa
2. venombed

creates: 

1. A_superfamily_sliced.fa

 -- splits first exon as exon1, and second exon as exon2.
for exon1, keeps protein for all good triplet nucleotides
for exon2, starts with the good triplet nucleotide

likely one amino acid is missing at the cut site, which occurs in the middle of a codon.
