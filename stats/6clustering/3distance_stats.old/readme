mapfile -- contains all gene superfamilies

python pdistvenom_wrapper.py --map mapfile.venomgenes

generates all possible comparisons. decided to use cd-hit at 80% threshold to cluster sequences so that the alignments weren't so insane
so that you could compare divergence in exons vs. adjacent introns


this creates a mapfile for all comparisons you want to do, so that you can split it up on multiple computers
