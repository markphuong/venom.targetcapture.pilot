############## create mapfile for gene superfamilies and create genefamily and region specific fasta files:

python separate.gene.families.py

creates: 

1. mapfile.genefamilies
2. *.superfamily.fa

################################


python pdistvenom_wrapper.py --map mapfile.genefamilies

generates all possible comparisons. decided to use cd-hit at 80% threshold to cluster sequences so that the alignments weren't so insane
so that you could compare divergence in exons vs. adjacent introns


this creates a mapfile for all comparisons you want to do, so that you can split it up on multiple computers


python makemapfile.py

python makebatchfiles.py


sbatch venomdistbatch0
sbatch venomdistbatch1
sbatch venomdistbatch2
sbatch venomdistbatch3

cat *.datapoint > venom.datapoint



### below did not happen second time I did this.

there are 14 datapoints missing from our dataset for whatever reason
discovered what they were with find_missing.py

which created map_notdoneyet

then did python pdist.venom.parallel.py --map map_notdoneyet

cat *datapoint > notdoneyet.datapoint

python filter_datapoints.and.annotate.py

cat venom.datapoint notdoneyet.datapoint >all.venom.datapoints

python checkunique.py

360230 - number of comparisons needed to be done

got 'region.distribution.for.scripting.stats' from /pylon2/bi4s86p/phuong/venom/stats/3exon_stats

python filter_datapoints.and.annotate.py

filters points if:

a. alignment length grew 20% more than the length of the longer exon
b. intron region is less than 50bp
c. shorter exon was less than 70% of the length of the longer exon
d. at least 50 points in entire gene family

creates:

1. venom.datapoints.filtered
2. venom.datapoints.filtered.enoughdatapoints - analyze this, filtered gene families with very few comparisons
