total number of gene families analyzeable was 47

1. gene.family.sizes.all -- all gene families that are not singletons (37 gene families
2. gene.family.sizes.70percent -- gene family is not extinct in at least 70% of the species
3. gene.family.sizes.captureable -- gene families that had 80% capture rate

you targeted 49 sequences, but you weren't able to successfully capture 2 families that were specific to californicus and only found in californicus.
