1. *phylo_contigs.fasta

sbatch mappingcapstatsbatch

did the above sbatch to run the following script:

python mapping_capstats.py --map mapfile

did this so you could get coverage and mapping % statistics. You chose the *phylo_contigs.fasta reference
for the phylogenetic markers, and did not include things dumped in the 'removed_overlappers' file 
you did this because you wanted to include most things before filtering for heterozygosity and coverage began,
but did not want to include unconfident contigs (ie. removed overlappers)

you used *_definedseqs_v4.fa for the venom reference because you wanted to use the reference
containing non masked gene models, before filtering coverage again

python get_coverage_stats_in_table.py
