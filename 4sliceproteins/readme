OBJECTIVE: from phuong et al. 2016, need to denote exon boundaries for the A superfamily proteins so that you can tell if the sequence is exon 1 or exon 2

for the 12 species with transcriptomes, brought the following:

1. _venom_contigs_reassembled.fa from /pylon2/bi4s86p/phuong/venom/3reassembled
2. all_extractedseq_renamed.fa from /nfs/LabShared/MarkPhuong/final/analyses/process_Summary_stats/2separateSpecies
3. all_proteins_renamed.fa from /nfs/LabShared/MarkPhuong/final/analyses/process_Summary_stats/2separateSpecies


python SeparateSpecies.py

-- separates the genes into two separate files.

creates:

1. _venomprots.fa
2. _extractedseq.fa



python venom_exon_wrapper.py --map species_name_mapping

-- wraps venom_exon_boundaries.py which does the following:

for each protein identified from transcriptome work, blast it to the assembled exon capture data venom genes for that specific gene family, 
and find the contigs that blast to the first and second exon/intron, then create a genomic sequence by combining the two contigs and
run exnerate and get the exact cutting coordinates.

creates:

1. *_venomblastcoordfile -- saves blast values for saved contigs that were used as the genomic sequence for exonerate to define exon/intron boundaries
2. *_venombed -- exact cut coordinates from exonerate

inferred exon had to be greater than 5bp in length to receive a 'didnotblast' flag

has 158 lines, because you have 79 A superfamily proteins, and every A protein has 2 exons
