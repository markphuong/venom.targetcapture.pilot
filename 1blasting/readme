cp ../0fix_reference/venom_reference.fa ./

some notes:
1. some parts of the sequences were filtered due to repetitive regions
2. included 100bp from each end of the coding region; some of these could not be extended out 100bp in each direction because they were poorly assembled

sbatch blastbatch

runs BlastWrapper.py


grabs any contig that matches the venom reference database (contig_filter_venom.py)
grabs all best hits that are non-overlapping because sometimes different venom gene exons would be on the same contig

needs:

1. *assemblies_clustered.fasta.NI files


creates:

1. *.blastoutput -- full blast output (query is the assembled spades contigs, db is the venom reference)
2. *_venom_filtered.blast -- (all non overlapping best hits per contig from the assembled spades contigs)
